- 👋 Hi, I’m @jareddls
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, and also a little in app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at CSUF for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I've recently started my upper-division classes,
      so I'm getting into the bulk of the classes that I do have heavy interest in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development projects, as I want experience in this field. I would love to learn
      any tips you'd have or how to get started and keep a steady progress on that type of thing.
